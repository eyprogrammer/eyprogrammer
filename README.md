Aspiring Data Analyst
---------------------

A data enthusiast with a passion for analytics with a focus on visualisation and reporting. Due to my past experiences, I have been able to work within the world of e-commerce and marketing as well as the sales industry which has allowed me to develop an array of skills. These skills include being able to work within a team as well as self-managing any individual tasks and responsibilities that are given to me, adhere to KPIs and analysing reports as well as problem solving and speaking to stakeholders within different industries. I’m currently enrolled on 12-week intensive Digital Skills Bootcamp Just IT Training in which I am solidifying both my technical and soft skills to become an accomplished data analyst, through completing in-class assignments and various projects to be published on my GitHub portfolio. I am eagerly looking to enter the world of Data as a junior Data Analyst to perfect and develop my skills alongside like-minded individuals who can assist me to grow my skill within the data sector.
